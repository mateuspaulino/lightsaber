# Lightsaber - in the browser #

I created this project, just for fun, I wanted to play with JavaScript Device Orientation (Gyroscope). I thought about a tribute to The Last Jedi. So, I built a Lightsaber, with sound effects, in the browser.
Note: Is a mobile only feature, you can also test if your device has the sensor.
